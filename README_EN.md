# Video Subtitle Master

English | [‰∏≠Êñá](./README.md)

Video Subtitle Master is a powerful desktop application for batch generating subtitles for videos and translating them into other languages. This project is an enhanced version of the open-source [VideoSubtitleGenerator](https://github.com/buxuku/VideoSubtitleGenerator), redesigned as a user-friendly client tool.

## About CUDA support

Because I use an Apple Silicon chip, I lack a Windows CUDA development environment. For CUDA support, there are many scenarios that are difficult to cover both in development and testing.

- Currently, CUDA 11.8.0 and 12.4.1 versions are provided through GitHub Actions, which may have compatibility issues with the environment
- To enable CUDA, you need to determine if your computer supports CUDA and has installed the CUDA toolkit. [CUDA download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- The version of the CUDA toolkit theoretically supports backward compatibility. Please choose the appropriate 11.8.0 or 12.4.1 version based on your graphics card support

## Core ML support

Starting from version 1.20.0, Core ML is supported on Apple Silicon, providing faster speech recognition. If you are using an Apple Silicon chip, please download the mac arm64 version of the release package. It will automatically enable Core ML acceleration.

## üí• Features

This application retains all the features of the original [VideoSubtitleGenerator](https://github.com/buxuku/VideoSubtitleGenerator) command-line tool, with the following enhancements:

- Graphical user interface for easier operation
- Source and target language subtitle files are saved in the same directory as the video for convenient subtitle attachment during playback
- Batch processing of video/audio/subtitle files
- Support for generating subtitles from video or audio files
- Ability to translate generated or imported subtitles
- Multiple translation services supported:
  - Volcano Engine Translation
  - Baidu Translation
  - DeepLX Translation (Note: Batch translation may be rate-limited)
  - Local Ollama model translation
  - Support for OpenAI-style API translations (e.g., [deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/), [azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/))
- Customizable subtitle file naming for compatibility with various media players
- Flexible translated subtitle content: choose between pure translation or original + translated subtitles
- Integrated `whisper.cpp` with optimization for Apple Silicon, offering faster generation speeds
- Built-in `fluent-ffmpeg`, eliminating the need for separate `ffmpeg` installation
- Support for running locally installed `whisper` command
- Option to choose model download source (domestic mirror or official source)
- Customizable number of concurrent tasks


## Translation Services

This project supports various translation services, including Baidu Translation, Volcano Engine Translation, DeepLX, local Ollama models, and OpenAI-style APIs. Using these services requires the appropriate API keys or configurations.

For information on obtaining API keys for services like Baidu Translation and Volcano Engine, please refer to https://bobtranslate.com/service/. We appreciate the information provided by [Bob](https://bobtranslate.com/), an excellent software tool.

## üî¶ Usage (For End Users)

Please download the appropriate package based on your computer's system, chip, and graphics card.

- The *generic* version is a universal version that theoretically supports most graphics cards
- The *optimized* version provides optimizations for various graphics card series, providing better compatibility

| System | Chip | Graphics Card | Download Package |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Windows | x64 | CUDA >= 11.8.0 < 12.0.0 | windows-x64_cuda11.8.0 |
| Windows | x64 | CUDA >= 12.0.0 | windows-x64_cuda12.4.1 |
| Windows | x64 | CUDA >= 12.2.0 | windows-x64_cuda12.2.0 |
| Windows | x64 | no CUDA | windows-x64_no_cuda |
| Mac | Apple | support CoreML | mac-arm64 |
| Mac | Intel | no support CoreML | mac-x64 |

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/buxuku/video-subtitle-master/releases) page and download the appropriate package for your operating system
2. Install and run the program
3. Configure the desired translation services within the application
4. Select the video or subtitle files you want to process
5. Set relevant parameters (e.g., source language, target language, model)
6. Start the processing task

## üî¶ Usage (For Developers)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the project locally

```shell
git clone https://github.com/buxuku/video-subtitle-master.git
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies using `yarn install` or `npm install`

```shell
cd video-subtitle-master
yarn install 
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ After installing dependencies, run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to launch the project

```shell
yarn dev
```

## Manually Downloading and Importing Models

Due to the large size of model files, downloading them through the software may be challenging. You can manually download models and import them into the application. Here are two links for downloading models:

1. Domestic mirror (faster download speeds):
   https://hf-mirror.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main

2. Hugging Face official source:
   https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main

If you are using an Apple Silicon chip, you need to download the corresponding encoder.mlmodelc file. After downloading, you can import the model files into the application using the "Import Model" feature on the "Model Management" page.

After downloading, you can import the model files into the application using the "Import Model" feature on the "Model Management" page. Or you can directly copy the model files to the model directory.

Import steps:
1. On the "Model Management" page, click the "Import Model" button.
2. In the file selector that appears, choose your downloaded model file.
3. After confirming the import, the model will be added to your list of installed models.

## Common Issues

##### 1. "The application is damaged and can't be opened" message
Execute the following command in the terminal:

```shell
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Video\ Subtitle\ Master.app
```
Then try running the application again.
